# Credit Risk - merge and combine datasets

<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data>

## Business Problem

Home Credit Group addresses the challenge of limited access to loans for individuals with insufficient credit histories. Many people face difficulties in obtaining loans, which makes them vulnerable to unreliable lenders. Home Credit strives to provide a positive and secure borrowing experience for this underserved population. They leverage alternative data sources, such as telco and transactional information, to assess clients' repayment abilities.

By utilizing statistical and machine learning techniques, Home Credit aims to unlock the full potential of their data and make accurate predictions. Their goal is to ensure that deserving individuals are not denied loans and to provide them with suitable loan terms and repayment schedules. Through this approach, Home Credit contributes to greater financial inclusion and empowers clients to achieve financial success.

### Load libraries

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(magrittr)
library(DT)

##import helper functions
source('helper_functions.R')
```

## Import Data

This dataset contains a relational schema of several tables. `application_{train|test}.csv` contains main information regarding the credit application including a primary key (`sk_id_curr`). applications_train contains 1 row per `sk_id_curr`. However other available datasets require aggreagtion before merging, including; bank balances, previous credit applications_train, etc contain information regarding previous loans (successful and unsuccessful), credit card spending, repayment history, etc

### Application data

Import `application_train.csv`, this is the main table which contains data regarding the credit application including the **target variable - whether or not the loan defaulted**.

Create additional features such as income ratios and discretise continuous features into binary (does applicant have children).

```{r}
read_applications <- function(path){
  df <- clean_read_csv(path) %>%
  mutate(
    #convert days_birth to age
    age = abs(days_birth)/365.25,
    age_group = cut(age, 
                    breaks = c(0, 30, 45, 60, Inf),
                    labels = c("under 30", "30-45", "45-60", "60+"),

    organization_type = organization_type %>% 
      gsub('Type \\d{1,2}|: type \\d{1,2}', '', .) %>% 
      trimws() %>% factor(),
    # Create a binary variable for childless applicants
    is_childless = ifelse(cnt_children == 0, 1, 0) %>% factor()
  ) %>% 
  select(-days_employed, -days_birth)
  
  return(df)
    
}
applications_train <- read_applications('data/application_train.csv')

```{r}

#C means closed, X means status unknown, 0 means no DPD, 1 means maximal did during month between 1-30, 2 means DPD 31-60,â€¦ 5 means DPD 120+ or sold or written off ]
bureau_balance <- clean_read_csv('data/bureau_balance.csv')
balance_status_to_numeric <- c(
  'C' = 0,'X' = 0, '0' = 0, '1' = 1, '2' = 2, '3' = 3, '4' = 4, '5' = 5

  as.numeric()

bureau_balance$months_balance <- abs(bureau_balance$months_balance)
bureau_balance$weighted_status <- bureau_balance$status_numeric/(bureau_balance$months_balance+1)




previous_credits <- clean_read_csv('data/bureau.csv') %>%
  # Replace NA values with zeros to avoid issues with ratios
  replace_na(list(

    amt_credit_sum_debt = 0,
    amt_credit_sum_overdue = 0,
    credit_day_overdue = 0, 
    amt_annuity = 0
  )) %>%
  mutate(
    # Calculate days since credit update
    days_since_credit_update = -days_credit_update,
    # Calculate the debt-to-credit ratio
    debt_to_credit_ratio = ifelse(amt_credit_sum == 0, 0, amt_credit_sum_debt / amt_credit_sum),
    # Calculate the overdue-to-credit ratio
    overdue_to_credit_ratio = ifelse(amt_credit_sum == 0, 0, amt_credit_sum_overdue / amt_credit_sum)
  )

dt_datatable_wrapper(previous_credits)

```

### Credit card data

The credit_card_balance.csv dataset contains information about monthly credit card balances for previous credits in Home Credit. It includes data such as the ID of previous credits, loan IDs, months of balance relative to the application date, balance amounts, credit card limits, amounts drawn, payment information, receivables, installment counts, contract statuses, and days past due.

The dataset provides insights into the credit card usage and payment behaviour of borrowers. It can be used to analyse trends in credit card balances, identify default patterns, and assess the creditworthiness of borrowers.

```{r}
credit_card_balances <- clean_read_csv('data/credit_card_balance.csv') %>%
  # Replace NAs with zero
  replace_na(list(
    amt_drawings_atm_current = 0, 
    amt_drawings_current = 0,
    amt_drawings_other_current = 0, 
    amt_drawings_pos_current = 0
  )) %>% 
  # Calculate the total drawings
  mutate(
    total_drawings = amt_drawings_atm_current + 
                     amt_drawings_current + 
                     amt_drawings_other_current + 
                     amt_drawings_pos_current,
    # Create a binary variable for delayed payments
    dpd_delayed = ifelse(sk_dpd > 0, 1, 0), 
    months_balance = abs(months_balance)
  )


dt_datatable_wrapper(credit_card_balances)
```

### Installment payment data

The `installments_payments.csv` dataset contains data on instalment payments for previous credits in Home Credit. It includes information such as previous credit IDs, loan IDs, instalment versions, numbers, due and payment days, prescribed and actual payment amounts. The dataset helps track payment behaviors, assess repayment patterns, and evaluate creditworthiness. It provides insights into borrowers' payment discipline and fulfilment of instalment obligations. This information is valuable for analyzing payment trends, predicting default risks, and optimizing loan management.

```{r}
installments_payments <- clean_read_csv('data/installments_payments.csv') %>% 
  ##replace NAs with zeros
  replace_na(list(days_entry_payment =0, amt_payment =0)) %>% 
  ##calculate new features based on existing data 
  mutate(
    amt_instalment = ifelse(amt_instalment==0, 0.1, amt_instalment),
    #when was the instalment paid relative to due date
    days_before_deadline =days_instalment-days_entry_payment,
    #binary feature for if instalment payment was late
    is_late = ifelse(days_before_deadline <0, 1, 0), 
    #how much of instalment value was paid
    perc_install_paid = amt_payment/amt_instalment, 
    #binary for if instalment wasn't fully paid
    is_underpaid = ifelse(perc_install_paid <1, 1,0 )
  )
  
dt_datatable_wrapper(installments_payments)

```

### Previous credit application data
